TODO List
=========

General
-------

* Delete "lectures" folder so this repo is only for code
* Update all references to code examples, so they are passed through a single liquid function that adds the base URL
* Add a bigger, nicer "Example on GitHub" button
* Generally structure the classes like I want the book
* Go through every single lecture and think about things I want to add.
* Rewrite the lectures with a separate view that parses them into reveal.js markup and runs the slideshow. Also make images automatically load the high-res ones based on names.
* Viking ships as both function and aesthetic. Odessa ship.

Intro
-----

* Write a small talk that introduces the class to the subject. Talk about Gerstner, my Paul Rand examples, etc. Use slides from "Duality of New Media Art"
* Add Donald Knuth's idea of MetaDesign in there. It's harder than design. To not just do it, but write how to do it. P. 14 metafont book.
* Add examples of Duality of New Media Art to end of history talk

Form
----

* Add Paul Rand repetition and randomization examples from Waza talk

Color
-----

* Make a broader introduction to what the different color modes are. Explain the use of CIE LAB in TColor, and why to use it (for calculating perceived contrast, etc)
* Remove the HSBColor class from examples and just use Toxiclibs TColor
* Show how TColor correctly converts minus values and big values into proper values in newHSV();
* Add as example: http://vimeo.com/82038912

Typography

* New example: https://vimeo.com/24358631
* Add more about the basic use of typography (baseline designs, sizes, etc)

* Add much more about Metafont. Use the metafont book for examples, quotes, etc.

Logo
----

* Add readings from Dynamic Identities book
* New example: Plask and Roskilde, http://vimeo.com/27737392
* New example: Sagmeister Engineering: http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/function-engineering/

Randomization
-------------

* Write more useful and beautiful examples

Reptition
---------

* Port shape grammar from Fleen: https://code.google.com/p/fleen/

Motion
------

* Use Karl Sims more: Galapagos, evolving creatures, etc.

Transformation
